## *Description:*
A minimal cellphone fashioned in "DieselPunk" style. DieselPunk is akin to SteamPunk - a modern object re-imagined as if it were made in the era from the 1930's to 1950's.

In the artwork supplied, I'm using the free downloadable Deco typefont from Nick Curtis, called "Dubba Dubba". If you like Nick's work, please contribute a few $$ at:
